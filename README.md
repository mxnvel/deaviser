# deaviser
This mini python script allows you to convert avi files to mp4. 
It is useful to to convert a lot of files at the same time although it is verry slow. 
Main use is for after effect since it can't read avi files


# usage

just run the program with `--dir [THE PATH OF THE FOLDER]`
ex: `python deaviser.py --dir C:\Users\usr\Documents\video\yourproject\rushs\`
It will then turn all the avi files of the folder its subfolders into mp4 files
Since this script is for my own use so it may not work for you.

ffmpeg needed btw
